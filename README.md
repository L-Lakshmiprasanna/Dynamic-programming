Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which can be solved independently. The idea is to store the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This approach is particularly useful in optimization problems where you need to find the optimal solution among many possible solutions.
